# Project Description

This is a simple react app that has 2 parts. The first is a TODO List (Create and Delete Items). The second is a display of exchange rate data using graphql and apollo.
I heavily relied on [this](https://www.kirupa.com/react/simple_todo_app_react.htm) for the todo list and [this](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/get-started/) for the exhange rate querying.
